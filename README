					the BEos Mame fRontend

BeMameR?!?!? What is it?!?

BeMameR is a Frontend for the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME).  Since I
think running MAME from the commandline is a pity, I wrote this little app.
It's free. You can use it and give it to anyone you want.


Requirements:
- BeOS R5
- Mame for BeOS (check www.beemulated.net)


Installation:
- Just unzip BeMameR wherever you want. It's done!


Nice Features:
- Show screenshots of games


ToDO:
- Game settings
- Clean up a lot of things
- Bugfixes


Known Bugs/Strange Behaviours:
- If BeMameR doesn't work for you, check your mame executable: if it's smaller
  than ~15Mb, you need to decompress it: open a terminal in the mame folder and
  write "gzexe -d mame"; hit enter.
- Sometimes makes MAME hang (just kill it with the BeOS team monitor) 
- Should show just available games
- Others which I can't remember


Thanks:
- to the MAME team, for the great work
- to Yoshi, who ported MAME to BeOS
- to Caz, who helped me to develop BeMameR, and explained me a lot of
  things about BeOS programming
- to Joao Pereira, for the splash screen image
